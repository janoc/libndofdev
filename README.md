Linux support for the 3Dconnexion SpaceBall, SpaceNavigator and joysticks in the SecondLife clients

Currently supported are the following devices (VID:PID):

  * 0x046d:0xc603   3Dconnexion SpaceMouse (untested)
  * 0x046d:0xc605   CADMan (untested)
  * 0x046d:0xc606   SpaceMouse Classic (untested)
  * 0x046d:0xc621   SpaceBall 5000 (tested, works)
  * 0x046d:0xc623   SpaceTraveller (untested)
  * 0x046d:0xc625   SpacePilot (untested)
  * 0x046d:0xc626   SpaceNavigator (tested, works)
  * 0x046d:0xc627   SpaceExplorer (untested - from Armin Weatherwax <Armin.Weatherwax (at) gmail.com>)
  * 0x046d:0xc628   SpaceNavigator for Notebooks (untested)
  * 0x046d:0xc629   SpacePilot Pro (untested)
  * 0x046d:0xc62b   SpaceMouse Pro (untested - from David Seikel < http://onefang.net/ >

  * 0x256f:0xc62e   SpaceMouse Wireless (cable) (untested)
  * 0x256f:0xc62f   SpaceMouse Wireless (receiver) (untested)
  * 0x256f:0xc631   SpaceMouse Wireless (untested)
  * 0x256f:0xc632   SpaceMouse Pro Wireless (untested)
  * 0x256f:0xc635   SpaceMouse Compact (untested - from Kai Werthwein < https://github.com/KaiWerthwein >

The following devices were contributed by Ricky Curtice (http://rwcproductions.com/):
(https://bitbucket.org/lindenlab/3p-libndofdev-linux/pull-request/1/open-277-linux-support-for-spacemousepro/diff)

CADMan, all SpaceMice (classic & wireless) except SpaceMouse Pro (non-wireless), SpaceNavigator for Notebooks

The devices marked as "untested" are expected to work and their VID:PIDs were sent to me by external contributors. I haven't tested them personally because I don't have that hardware, they could work, could be completely broken or anything inbetween. Caveat emptor. However, please do report any working or not working devices from the list above - that's only way to get the problems fixed.

In addition, the library supports every joystick/gamepad device supported by the SDL library.


C A U T I O N !!!
-----------------

DO NOT USE THIS LIBRARY FOR ADDING SUPPORT FOR THE 3Dconnexion HARDWARE TO NEW APPLICATIONS!

This library is a messy hack emulating the proprietary 3Dconnexion SDK, in order to simplify the SecondLife
client integration. If you are looking to integrate support for these devices into a new application,
a much better solution is to use the event interface directly. An example of how to do this can be found
here:
  * http://janoc.rd-h.com/files/software/linux/spacenav/spacenavig.c

If you are building a virtual reality application, then the best option is to use the VRPN library:
  * http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/vrpn/

VRPN supports all the devices above and many more in a transparent and abstract manner, so you don't have
to add support for each different interaction device or tracker specially.
